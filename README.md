# Gym Attendance Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes gym attendance data using Python and presents the insights through both a Jupyter Notebook and a simple Streamlit web application. The goal is to understand attendance patterns, peak hours/days, and overall trends that can help in planning gym resources and schedules.

## Dataset
- **Gym_Attendance_Dataset.xlsx**  
  Contains gym attendance records used for analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Load and display gym attendance data  
- Basic data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Visualizations of attendance trends  
- Simple interactive interface using Streamlit  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Streamlit  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## How to Run Locally
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py  

## Notebook Usage
Open `Gym.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to view the full analysis and visualizations.

## Results & Insights
The analysis highlights attendance patterns and peak time periods, which can help gym management with better planning and decision-making.

## Future Improvements
- Add filters for date/time in the Streamlit app  
- Add more visualizations  
- Perform deeper analysis (e.g., weekday vs weekend trends)
